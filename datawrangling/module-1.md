Welcome to the first session! This first module will focus on making sure everyone is on the same page regarding the syllabus, deliverables, small group assignment and other administrative details.  We will also make sure you are up and running with R, RStudio, and Slack.

## Tutorials & Resources

Please read & work through the following prior to our first class. 

### Syllabus

If you have not already done so, be sure to read through the syllabus for your section [[OPER-682]](oper682) [[LOGM-682]](logm682) so that you understand the structure of my classes, the tentative schedule, grading policies, and other pertinent details.

### Communication

[Slack](https://slack.com/) will replace e-mail and Blackboard for our course. You will receive an invitation to the [AFIT DSL slack team](https://afit-dsl.slack.com/). You may wish to install one of the [apps](https://slack.com/downloads/osx). If you have any questions or concerns your first step should be to go to our [class slack channel](https://afit-dsl.slack.com/) and post your issue.  You and your classmates should be monitoring slack to help each other out. In addition, I will also be watching slack and will chime in when necessary but my hope is that this will be a social process where everyone contributes to knowledge advancement.

- Watch and read the introductory material to get started with Slack [here](https://slack.com/is).
- You can also read this [introduction to Slack](https://vimeo.com/133692325) from one of Kris Shafferâ€™s courses (although this is a completely different course and slack team it provides a nice introduction that you might find useful). 
- Sign into the Slack channel and post a witty comment.
