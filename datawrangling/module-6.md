In this module, you will learn a consistent way to organize your data in R, an organization called "tidy" data. Getting your data into this format requires some upfront work, but that work pays off in the long term. Once you have tidy data and the tidy tools provided by packages in the tidyverse, you will spend much less time munging data from one representation to another, allowing you to spend more time on the analytic questions at hand.

## Continued Learning

To build on to what you learned in class and to improve your skills read & work through the following prior to next week’s classes. 

1. __Tidy Data:__ Read and work through [Chapter 12: Tidy Data](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html) in R for Data Science to learn how to organize your data the "tidy" way.
2. __Managing Data Structures:__ R’s base data structures can be organized by their dimensionality (1d, 2d, or nd) and whether they’re homogeneous (all contents must be of the same type) or heterogeneous (the contents can be of different types). This gives rise to five data types most often used in data analysis, and the five data types that nearly all R objects and outputs are built upon.  You already have a strong understanding of data frames; however, it's important to understand and appropriately manage the other data structures as you will likely come across them down the road.  Read and work through:
   - [Data structure basics](structure_basics)
   - [Managing vectors](vectors)
   - [Managing matrices](matrices)
   - [Managing lists](lists)
   - [Managing data frames](dataframes)
   - [Managing tibbles](tibbles)
