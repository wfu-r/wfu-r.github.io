__Handling factors:__ In R, factors are used to work with categorical variables, variables that have a fixed and known set of possible values. They are also useful when you want to display character vectors in a non-alphabetical order.

__Managing date-time data:__ At first glance, dates and times seem simple. You use them all the time in your regular life, and they donâ€™t seem to cause much confusion. But within R, they can be a bit daunting to work with.

In R, working with factors, dates and times *can* be simple when using the right tools. This module will teach you those tools for working with these types of data.
