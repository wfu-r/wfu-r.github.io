Being able to create visualizations (graphical representations) of data is a key step in being able to communicate information and findings to others. In this module you will learn to use the `ggplot2` library to visualize your data. Although R does provide built-in plotting functions, the `ggplot2` library implements the [Grammar of Graphics](https://www.amazon.com/Grammar-Graphics-Statistics-Computing/dp/0387245448). This makes it particularly effective for describing how visualizations should represent data, and has turned it into the preeminent plotting library in R. Learning this library will allow you to make nearly any kind of (static) data visualization, customized to your exact specifications.

## Continued Learning

The following tutorials will provide you the knowledge and skills required to create the meaningful, elegant, and finely tuned  data visualizations that I will be looking for in your final project.

1. __Introduction to `ggplot2`:__ Read and work through [Chapter 3: Data Visualization](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html) in R for Data Science to get a more thorough introduction to the `ggplot2` package.

2. __Advancing your visualizations:__ In your final project I will be looking for publication worthy visualizations. Thus, I fully expect your visualizations to improve with each deliverable submitted. Therefore it is essential that you learn how to use some of the more advanced features of `ggplot2` and other packages that work with `ggplot2`.  Here are some resources to help you take your visualizations to the next level:  
    - Reading and working through [Chapter 28: Graphics for Communication](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/graphics-for-communication.html) in R for Data Science.
    - Review some of the currently available [advanced plotting tutorials](ggplot).
