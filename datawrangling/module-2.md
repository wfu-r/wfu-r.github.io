The workflow one uses for data analysis will determine the efficiency and reproducibility of that analysis. For example...

- one day you will need to stop in the middle of your analysis, go do something else and then the next day return to your analysis and pick up where you left off. 
- one day you will be working on multiple analyses simultaneously and you will want to keep them organized in a separate fashion. 
- one day you will need to go back to an analysis you did two months ago and re-execute the analysis with new data.
- one day you will need to turn your thesis analysis into a written report and then convert the same analysis into a defense presentation.

To be an effective and efficient analyst you need to understand how to manage your analytic workflow so that it fosters an organized environment and allows you to easily reproduce your work.  Furthermore, our data analysis should rarely live independent from our written report but, rather, be integrated with it.  This module will teach you how to organize your R files with R Projects and how you can use R Markdown in notebook mode for analyst-to-analyst communication, and in report mode for analyst-to-decision-maker communication.

## Continued Learning

To build on to what you learned in class and to improve your skills read & work through the following prior to next weekâ€™s classes.

- Read the [R Projects tutorial](r_projects) and watch the [Projects in RStudio webinar](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/rstudio-essentials-webinar-series-managing-change-part-1/).
- Read the [R Markdown tutorial](r_markdown) and watch the [Getting Started with R Markdown webinar](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/getting-started-with-r-markdown/). This webinar will walk through the same example I used in class so if you missed anything or want to review something we went over you can easily do so.
- __Optional:__ Read the [R Notebooks tutorial](r_notebook) and watch the [Introducing Notebooks with R Markdown webinar](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/introducing-notebooks-with-r-markdown/).
