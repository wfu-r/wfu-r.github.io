So far we've been working with built-in data and data provided by R packages.  Although this is a great way to learn the tools of data science, at some point you want to start working with your own data. In this module, you’ll learn how to read in, and write to, text, Excel, and R data object files. We’ll only scratch the surface of data importing and exporting in class but you'll be pointed to several tutorials that will allow you to learn more advanced topics such as scraping data and using APIs.
