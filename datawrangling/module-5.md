So far we've been working with built-in data and data provided by R packages.  Although this is a great way to learn the tools of data science, at some point you want to start working with your own data. In this module, you’ll learn how to read in, and write to, text, Excel, and R data object files. We’ll only scratch the surface of data importing and exporting in class but you'll be pointed to several tutorials that will allow you to learn more advanced topics such as scraping data and using APIs.

## Continued Learning

To build on to what you learned in class and to improve your skills read & work through the following prior to next week’s classes.

- __Class Re-cap: Importing and exporting spreadsheet data__
    - Read & work through the [Importing Data tutorial](import).
    - Read & work through the [Exporting Data tutorial](exporting).
        - Newbies can focus on the following sections of this tutorial: [exporting to text files](exporting#export_text_files) and [exporting to R objects](exporting#export_r_objects).
        - Optional: Those more ambitious can also work through [exporting to Excel portion](exporting#export_excel_files).
- __Scraping text & tables__
    - Read & work through the [Importing spreadsheet data files stored online](scraping#importing_spreadsheet_data) portion of the [Scraping Data tutorial](/scraping)
    - Optional: For those more advanced folks, work through the following sections of the [Scraping Data tutorial](scraping): [Scraping HTML text](scraping#scraping_HTML_text), [Scraping HTML tables](scraping#scraping_HTML_tables), and [Leveraging APIs to scrape data](scraping#scraping_api)
- __Learn about the data__
    - When first opening a data set it is important to get a basic understanding of the data dimensions (rows and columns), what the data looks like, how many missing values are in the data, and some basic summary statistics such as mean, median, and the range of each variable. Read and work through [*Learn About the Data*](about_the_data) to understand some of the first things you should do with a fresh data set.
